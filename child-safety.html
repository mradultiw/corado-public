    <h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 04, 2026</p>

    <p>At <strong>Corado</strong>, we are committed to providing a safe environment for all users. We have a <strong>Zero Tolerance Policy</strong> regarding Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE).</p>

    <h2>1. Our Stance Against CSAE</h2>
    <p>We strictly prohibit the uploading, sharing, or soliciting of content that depicts, promotes, or normalizes child sexual abuse or exploitation. This includes, but is not limited to, Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), grooming behaviors, sextortion, and the trafficking of children.</p>

    <h2>2. Detection and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>To keep our platform safe, we employ the following measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Reporting:</strong> An in-app mechanism allows users to immediately report suspicious content or behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> Reported content is reviewed by our safety team to identify violations of this policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Reporting to Authorities</h2>
    <p>If we identify any content or behavior related to CSAE, we will take immediate action, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Removal:</strong> The content will be permanently removed from our platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Termination:</strong> The responsible user account will be immediately banned.</li>
        <li><strong>NCMEC Reporting:</strong> We will report the incident and user details to the <em>National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)</em> and relevant law enforcement authorities as required by law.</li>
    </ul>
